# GridProject
This is a project that showcases a breakdown of my stats from the popular online sports game, Immaculate Grid. I was able to gather all necessary statistics, whether personal or game related, straight from the archived grids on the website. The only thing I had to go off of the website to get was the location of each team's stadium, and the distance (in miles) away from my location; I gathered the addresses from the team's website and the mileage from Google Maps.
